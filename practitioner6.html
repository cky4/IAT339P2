Josh Doornenbal

	Trent Murdoch

Mike Clark
"Thanks Abe, for keeping me tunned up for every big tournament. You were a key piece in my success this year as well as the past couple of years."

Jason Wright
I wanted to thank the two of you for the incredible help getting me back to running in such a short time frame. The Mt. Robson 46k was my first "ultra" and the best experience I've ever had in my life. I know that without seeing you guys over the last few weeks, and getting the help with my hip it wouldn't have been possible. I got a ton of confidence from not only the treatment, but also just talking with you two. It was nice being treated as a competitive athlete, rather than looked at as a crazy person who needs to stop and take time off. My hip was not an issue the whole race, and still isn't two days later.

Danica Cederberg
Dr. Avender,
I wanted to thank you for what you did for me. Thanks to you, I've had a much quicker recovery than what was expected, and it means a lot.
Thank you,

Danica Cederberg

Island Optimal Health and Performance has been an integral part of my athletic and academic life. I spent the last five years as an athlete and student at Vancouver Island University. During this time, I was treated both by Dr. Abe Avender and Dr. Joe Foglia for a variety of sport-related injuries. I also shadowed under Dr. Clare Craig as an internship student. I couldn’t have asked for better professional treatment. Each practitioner was extremely well rounded and knowledgeable in their fields. Following graduation I have become a member of the Canadian Women’s National Volleyball team. The care provided by Island Optimal has continued to parallel and surpass any treatment I have received as an athlete at the international level. I owe a great deal to the entire community at Island Optimal; they have provided support, guidance and friendship, all while showing their dedication to providing their clients with the highest level of care. - Dani Smith
