"Without Joe's work on my shoulder, I wouldn't have been able to play in my fifth and final year of eligibility.  Because of his treatment and rehab program, I was able to get my shoulder feeling the best it ever has in my volleyball career.  Not only did he make sure my shoulder was feeling good, but he went out of his way to support me and the team by staying involved in our season.  Thanks for everything!!"</p>

		<p>  Stephen Ewashko "I had a sprained MCL, BCCAA Provincials in a week and I was worried I wouldn't be able to play. With Joe's treatment and advice, I was able to start in every game and play until the final whistle, helping our team win the Provincial and National Championships. Injuries are a part of the game, and without the right help it could've cost me the dream season. Thankfully I had Dr. Foglia's expertise and knowledge, enabling me to focus on my task at hand and bring home the National Trophy to VIU for the first time since 1983. Thanks again for everything!"</p>

"Joe helped get me back to the start line, after almost a year off from injury, and in my first race back I was only 6 seconds off of my personal best 6km (Westwood Lake) record from last year! Good sign!"</p>

"Abe, Thanks for keeping me healthy and in the sand."

Andrew Ornoch
"Thanks for all your help Abe, your treatments and motivation to get me even better than I was before I came to see you will always an inspiration to me. Your thoroughness and ability to help me get back to an elite level at a critical time in my life was greatly appreciated."

Isaac Weintraub
"Abe, Thanks so much for all the help in getting me back to health and back on the golf course. I can tell you are really invested in your patient's endeavors. Thanks so much for all your help."

Spencer Bowman
"Abe's passion for helping and healing is obvious every time he treats my arms. He keeps me behind the kit and hitting hard. Thanks Abe!"

Josh Doornenbal
"Two Practices a day with endless swings are a breeze when you have Abe in your corner to put your shoulder back together."

Maverick Hatch
"I was back in action before anyone thought I'd be. Thanks a lot Abe, couldn't have done it without your help."
	Trent Murdoch
"Abe, Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to make me stronger and faster than ever before."

Mike Clark
"Thanks Abe, for keeping me tunned up for every big tournament. You were a key piece in my success this year as well as the past couple of years."

Jason Wright
I wanted to thank the two of you for the incredible help getting me back to running in such a short time frame. The Mt. Robson 46k was my first "ultra" and the best experience I've ever had in my life. I know that without seeing you guys over the last few weeks, and getting the help with my hip it wouldn't have been possible. I got a ton of confidence from not only the treatment, but also just talking with you two. It was nice being treated as a competitive athlete, rather than looked at as a crazy person who needs to stop and take time off. My hip was not an issue the whole race, and still isn't two days later.

Danica Cederberg
Dr. Avender,
I wanted to thank you for what you did for me. Thanks to you, I've had a much quicker recovery than what was expected, and it means a lot.
Thank you,

Danica Cederberg

Island Optimal Health and Performance has been an integral part of my athletic and academic life. I spent the last five years as an athlete and student at Vancouver Island University. During this time, I was treated both by Dr. Abe Avender and Dr. Joe Foglia for a variety of sport-related injuries. I also shadowed under Dr. Clare Craig as an internship student. I couldn’t have asked for better professional treatment. Each practitioner was extremely well rounded and knowledgeable in their fields. Following graduation I have become a member of the Canadian Women’s National Volleyball team. The care provided by Island Optimal has continued to parallel and surpass any treatment I have received as an athlete at the international level. I owe a great deal to the entire community at Island Optimal; they have provided support, guidance and friendship, all while showing their dedication to providing their clients with the highest level of care. - Dani Smith
