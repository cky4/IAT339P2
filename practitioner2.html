			<h6>Information</h6>
			<p><strong>DC, BHSc, CSCS, FR®Lower Limb </strong></p>
			<p>
			As Dr. Butler advanced her studies in human anatomy, physical functioning and health, she discovered the powerful relationship between yoga and Chiropractic, as they both center their main principles on the idea of balance. As a student of yoga herself, Dr. Butler is very passionate about helping her patients and yoga students alike find the balance they seek in their bodies by assessing and treating faulty movement patterns, postural imbalances, and tight or weak muscles to help treat injuries and prevent future occurrences. Once balance can be created in one aspect of life, often helping people work their way out of physical pain it will be easier to find balance in other aspects of life and Dr. Butler strongly believes yoga is a great start towards this.
			</p>
			<p>
			Kristen's enthusiasm for helping people and passion for yoga also show in the classes she teaches. She teaches her yoga classes through eyes of a health professional with focus on finding balance by strengthening weak muscles, stretching tight areas of the body, finding endurance in core muscles, and aligning movement with the breath for relaxation, injury prevention, and treatment.

Mike Clark
"Thanks Abe, for keeping me tunned up for every big tournament. You were a key piece in my success this year as well as the past couple of years."

Jason Wright
I wanted to thank the two of you for the incredible help getting me back to running in such a short time frame. The Mt. Robson 46k was my first "ultra" and the best experience I've ever had in my life. I know that without seeing you guys over the last few weeks, and getting the help with my hip it wouldn't have been possible. I got a ton of confidence from not only the treatment, but also just talking with you two. It was nice being treated as a competitive athlete, rather than looked at as a crazy person who needs to stop and take time off. My hip was not an issue the whole race, and still isn't two days later.

Danica Cederberg
Dr. Avender,
I wanted to thank you for what you did for me. Thanks to you, I've had a much quicker recovery than what was expected, and it means a lot.
Thank you,

Danica Cederberg

Island Optimal Health and Performance has been an integral part of my athletic and academic life. I spent the last five years as an athlete and student at Vancouver Island University. During this time, I was treated both by Dr. Abe Avender and Dr. Joe Foglia for a variety of sport-related injuries. I also shadowed under Dr. Clare Craig as an internship student. I couldn’t have asked for better professional treatment. Each practitioner was extremely well rounded and knowledgeable in their fields. Following graduation I have become a member of the Canadian Women’s National Volleyball team. The care provided by Island Optimal has continued to parallel and surpass any treatment I have received as an athlete at the international level. I owe a great deal to the entire community at Island Optimal; they have provided support, guidance and friendship, all while showing their dedication to providing their clients with the highest level of care. - Dani Smith
